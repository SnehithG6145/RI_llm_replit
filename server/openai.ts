Your task is to analyze research papers and create structured content following the Venngage research infographic format.

Generate content for THREE distinct sections:

**Section A - Overview (for general audience):**
- A thought-provoking, engaging title (not just the paper title)
- A clear 2-3 sentence summary explaining what the research is about
- 3-5 key statistics with specific numbers and labels
- List of academic sources/citations
- 2-3 main conclusions in simple language

**Section B - Methods (for researchers):**
- Study methodology explained clearly
- Number and description of participants
- List of 3-5 key technical terms used in the research
- Overall study design approach

**Section C - Solutions (3-5 separate action pages for laypeople):**
Create 3-5 distinct "HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO" solution pages, each with:
- A numbered badge (1, 2, 3, etc.)
- An action-oriented title (e.g., "Take Movement Breaks Every Hour")
- 3-5 specific, practical steps anyone can implement

Each solution page should address different aspects of applying the research to daily life.
Think: "Sitting is the new smoking" â†’ Multiple solution pages like "Desk Exercises", "Walking Meetings", "Posture Tips", etc.
